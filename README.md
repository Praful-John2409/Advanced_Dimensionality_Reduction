# Advanced Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This repository demonstrates the implementation of various dimensionality reduction techniques using diverse datasets, including image data (e.g., olivetti_faces) and tabular data (e.g., diabetes). It explores the power of dimensionality reduction methods in simplifying data visualization, improving model efficiency, and uncovering hidden patterns.

The repository is divided into three Jupyter notebooks, each tailored for a specific dataset and covering a range of advanced techniques. Additionally, dimensionality reduction has been implemented using both Colab and Databricks, showcasing compatibility and flexibility across platforms.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

The following dimensionality reduction methods have been explored and implemented in this project:

1. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**: A technique that captures non-linear structures in data.
2. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Focused on interactive visualization, highlighting clusters effectively.
3. **ISOMAP**: Preserves global data structures by embedding data into a lower-dimensional space.
4. **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Interactive visualization with high computational efficiency.
5. **MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling)**: Maintains the distance structure of data.
6. **Randomized PCA**: Accelerates PCA computations for large datasets.
7. **Kernel PCA**: Extends PCA by incorporating kernel methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction.
8. **Incremental PCA**: Ideal for large datasets, processes data incrementally to reduce memory usage.
9. **Factor Analysis**: Focuses on identifying latent variables and understanding data structures.
10. **Autoencoders**: Leverages neural networks for non-linear dimensionality reduction.
